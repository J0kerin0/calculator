# calculator

This is a simple calculator with an option to solve quadratic equations built on notepad.
You can build it with:
cmd> cd //path to .txt code> C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\csc.exe mycalc.cs
this will create an executable app ta opens on cmd.
I hope you find it somewhat usefull.
